# ps-template-reactV18

This is my newish-to-purescript take on a robust method of creating new web apps, based on articles by 
the following authors
- Charles Scalfani, Functional Programming Made Easier (recommends local install of purescript and spago)
- https://github.com/JordanMartinez/purescript-jordans-reference/blob/latestRelease/31-Design-Patterns/09-Project-Prelude.md
- https://github.com/megamaddu/purescript-react-basic-hooks/blob/main/docs/getting-started.md

Use this repo as a template, by cloning it to a new foldername and changing the remote origin to point at the new repo name
